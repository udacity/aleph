# Udacity Aleph [Work In Progress ðŸš§]
Collaborative projects from the real world.

### What is Udacity Aleph?
Udacity Aleph is an initiative that let students, transfer key skills learned from a nanodegree to the real-world. As part of the initiative we will roll out challenges every month. The challenges will require students to work on real problems along with one or more **collaborators**. Students who participate in the challnges will pick up **verifiable badges** containing _Udascore_ points representing mastery of a tool or technique.

The badges can be verified online and are tied to your email.

### Who can participate?
Anyone who is currently enrolled in a Udacity nanodegree. Although the challenges may require skills from a particular nanodegree, there is no restriction based on which nanodegree you are enrrolled in.

### How to participate
You need to form a team, complete a sequence of tasks and then fill a form. The type and difficulty of the tasks will change from one challenge to the next. Find out more in the [List of Challenges](#List-of-Challenges) section. 

### Why are the challenges collaborative?
We decided to make the challenges collaborative for the following reasons

- Many challenges require significant work that can be divided among team members.
- You get a taste of working in a distributed team.
- Working in a group can be a very efficient learning process.
- Team work has beings along challenges as well and we hope you learn to navigate them.

### What kind of challenges are in the offing?
We are starting off with a Kaggle competition but the intention is to have much more diverese competitions involving problems from data gathering to building machine learning pipelines to deploying them on the web and building web and mobile applications. We promise that the projects will be so exiciting that you won't be able stop yourself from jumping in!    

### How much time does one get to submit a solution?
The time will vary from challenge to challenge. Please find out more in the [List of Challenges](#List-of-Challenges) section.

### Body Fat Prediction
**About Body Fat Prediction**
The body fat prediction challenge is a private Kaggle competition for Udacity students. 

The goal of the challenge is to be able to predict the percentage of body fat, given a person's body measurements from their neck, chest, abdomen and other areas. The challenge comes from having to learn models on small data. Despite the prevalence of big data everywhere, when it comes to solving many real-world problems, there's often a shortage of data in many domains. Many problems in healthcare and medicine fall in this category since data collection in these domains requires enough participants (humans), data collection is often tedious, costly, requires formal consent and involves privacy issues. Body fat prediction is one such problem.

Body fat prediction from simple body measurements has immediate utility, for example, in health apps, to predict fitness levels. The main challenge is to build a reliable model from the tiny data in this dataset. If we had millions of rows of data, building a highly accurate, black box model would be almost trivial. However, to get every last ounce of performance from a machine learning model trained on small data, one has to carefully analyze and tune its performance.

**How to Participate**
- Join the [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/Udacity-Aleph/bodyfat#) for this challenge.
- Create an account on Kaggle
- Add your details to [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nm4srsFa1xHal8u4yOAlFk-VKU4I6LC8HZ9jZ_hckMc/edit?usp=sharing) Google sheet. You can either add your name to an exsisting team or create a new team. A team must have at least two members and at most four.If you enter as the first team member, you are the team's leader. If you are the leader select the number of members you want to be a part of the team (you can edit the number later). If you are not the leader, check that the team's member count is still lower than the limit set by team leader.
