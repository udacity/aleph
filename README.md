# Udacity Aleph [Work In Progress ðŸš§]
Collaborative projects from the real world.

### What is Udacity Aleph?
Udacity Aleph is an initiative that let students, transfer key skills learned from a nanodegree to the real-world. As part of the initiative we will roll out challenges every month. The challenges will require students to work on real problems along with one or more **collaborators**. Students who participate in the challnges will pick up **verifiable badges** containing points or **Udacores** representing mastery of a tool or technique.

The badges can be verified online and are tied to your email 
 
### Who can participate?
Anyone who is currently enrolled in a Udacity nanodegree. Although the challenges may require skills from a particular nanodegree, there is no restriction based on which nanodegree you are enrrolled in.

### How to participate
Roughly you need to form a team, complete a sequence of tasks and then fill a form. The type and difficulty of the tasks will change from one challenge to the next. Find out more in the [List of Challenges](#List-of-Challenges) section.
