# Udacity Aleph [Work In Progress ðŸš§]
Collaborative projects from the real world.

### What is Udacity Aleph?
Udacity Aleph is an initiative that let students, transfer key skills learned from a nanodegree to the real-world. As part of the initiative we will roll out challenges every month. The challenges will require students to work on real problems along with one or more **collaborators**. Students who participate in the challnges will pick up **verifiable badges** containing points or **Udacores** representing mastery of a tool or technique.
